The SideQuest is designed to simplify sideloading apps onto your standalone android based headset. It should include everything you need to get started. When you first open the app it is best to open the setup screen and follow the instructions on screen to get setup. 

It is important to follow the instructions in the setup screen before you start - particularily installing the OpenStore Launcher app to be able to find the apps on your device once they are installed.



## SideQuest Features

* Automatic download of ADB platform-tools for your platform - win/mac/linux.
* Setup instructions for enablding developer mode on your device.
* On device launcher app to be able to open the apps once installed.
* Drag and drop support for installing arbitrary apps.
* Repository seeding via sources.txt file to preload your own repos for distribution.
* Add custom fdroid based repositories to get more apps.



## Setup 

When you first launch SideQuest it will download the repositories and also download the ADB tools. Once this is done you should go to the Setup menu option and follow through the one time setup to get your device ready to install apps. 

If you have any problems you can hit the debugger icon to capture any errors - these will really help to find and fix bugs.

## Apps

I will be adding more apps to the repos and I will be notifying of repo updates on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/Q2a5BkZ) - you can then manually update the repos in the repos section to get the new app listings.
